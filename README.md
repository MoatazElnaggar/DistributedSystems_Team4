## Features

•	System has the ability of supporting multiple, autonomous agents/computers (human or automated) and managing shared resources between the agents.
•	Any agent/computer should just have a link to access the application.
•	System’s state to be distributed upon several client or server nodes.
•	System should be strong enough to be reliable for not crashing.
•	System resumes its operations in its last reached state if one node crashes.
•	System recovers the state of the crashing node in order for it to continue its operation.
•	System managing real-time editing and viewing by several participants.
•	An agent can see how many agents are editing the document he/she is editing.
•	Maintaining replicas for fault tolerance.
•	Caching/Copy migration to minimize application response time.
•	Backup server



## Deployment

To achieve that multiple computers/users all access at the same time the Web Application we need to deploy/host the Web Application on a PAAS Cloud, so we hosted our QM Editor on Heroku which is a platform as a service (PAAS) Cloud and it provides an OS and an environment for running the application where in our case, OS is Linux and environment installed is Node-JS.
